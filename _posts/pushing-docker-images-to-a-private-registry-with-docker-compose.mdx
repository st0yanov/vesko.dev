Recently I was looking for a way to push services’ images of a Docker Compose project to a private registry. In this article I’m going to save you some guesswork as the process is a bit ambiguous.

Before we go any further let’s first set up the stage.
We have a simple **docker-compose.yml** file with the following contents:

```bash
version: '3'

services:
  myapp:
    build: ./services/myapp
```

I want to build the image and push it to my private Docker registry.

```bash
docker-compose build
```

So far so good. Everything builds well. I decide to check my local images:

```bash
docker images
```

And the first issue I notice is the bad naming of my image:
`“myprojectname_myapp latest”`

Easy fix — if you specify image as well as build configuration options, docker-compose will build the image with the specified image name and tag, [as described in the docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#build):

```bash
version: '3'

services:
  myapp:
    image: myproject/myapp:latest
    build: ./services/myapp
```

Now my image has appropriate naming and I want to push it. With the current setup, however, `docker-compose push` will try to push the project’s images to the Docker Hub registry. I don’t want this to happen.

At first glance [the compose file reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) doesn’t provide neither configuration nor information on how to push images to a private registry.

> If y*ou* want to push an image to a private registry you need to [follow those instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/#push-a-new-image-to-a-registry):\
>
> 1. `docker tag myproject/myapp:latest my-registry-host:5000/myproject/myapp:latest`\
>
> 2. `docker push my-registry-host:5000/myproject/myapp:latest`

There are some guides on the Internet suggesting automating those steps with a script but I don’t like this solution as I want to use the native tooling. A few minutes later I arrived at [the docker-compose push documentation page](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/push/) which includes a nice example.

> It looks like the image service configuration option follows the same notation as the example above:

```bash
version: '3'

services:
  myapp:
    image: my-registry-host:5000/myproject/myapp:latest
    build: ./services/myapp
```

Now when I execute `docker-compose push` my image gets pushed to my private image registry. There is something that still annoys me though — if I decide to change the registry, I need to edit the image configuration option of all described services.

> For this reason I like to extract the registry host as an environment variable:

```bash
REGISTRY_HOST=my-registry-host:5000
```

```bash
version: '3'

services:
  myapp:
    image: ${REGISTRY_HOST}/myproject/myapp:latest
    build: ./services/myapp
```

Congratulations! Now you will be able to build and distribute your project’s images by only using the native tooling provided by Docker and Docker Compose.
